This is the client side of the Timer Billing App.

The API repo can be found at - https://github.com/mxdavis/timer-billing-app

It is an open sourced billing app made by and for developers.

If you fork or clone the repo, upon download you need to run yarn install, and yarn start.
You will need to run rails start before starting the client side, because rails needs to run on port 3000, while yarn should run on 3001

Submit any issues or feature requests via a pull request.

This app is deployed to heroku:
